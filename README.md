# Railway-Booking-System
I Developed a Console Based Project on Railway Ticket Booking System using Python
Can Book, Edit and Delete Ticket from given Options of cities in India.
Connect Python with Database by MySQL connection so all the data get stored in dataset. 
Perform CRUD operation.
Additionally we have to install mysql server on our system (ex. XAMPP server),this will help in Data Saving and perform all other CRUD operation.
